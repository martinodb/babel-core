;; Experimental cip-priorities, not thoroughly tested yet.
;; TODO: write tests.
;;
;; 15/03/2016: The new version of this cip-priority method looks at all units involved in matching, and not to
;;             particular constraints anymore. It is therefore compatible with any kind of grammar (both constituent-,
;;             dependency-, or a mixed grammr.
;; 30/06/2016: Making parts of the node test standalone functions so they can be shared.
;; 01/07/2016: Including priority based on semantic coherence. Very rough approach.
