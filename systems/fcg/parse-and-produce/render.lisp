;; order), or a list of allowed orderings.

;; Nodes for units that do not occur in the initial structure but
;; occur in a string specifications are also added to the tree at the
;; same level as the nodes in which it is related to via form constraints.
 
;; Finally, meets and precedes constraints are handled by deleting
;; orderings not allowed by them from the nodes in the tree.
