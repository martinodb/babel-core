;;; General extensible matcher and merger.

;;; This code is an extension to Norvig's unifier code in "Paradigms
;;; of AI, Case studies in CL."

;;; Unification in this book is what is called matching in the FCG
;;; formalism: It looks for variable bindings to make two expressions
;;; equal.

;;; The extensions are:

;;; 1) The matcher (unifier) is extensible by setting a symbol's S
;;; unify-fn property to a function (unify-S x y bindings-list) of three
;;; variables x y and bindings-list. Whenever the unifier is called as
;;; (unify (S ...) y bindings-list) or (unify y (S ...) bindings-list) the
;;; unify-S funcion will be called with variables (S ...) y and
;;; bindings-list.

;;; _ is a wildcard (matches anything):
;; (unify '_ '(hello 2 you)) => (+no-bindings+)
;;; Also the tail of a list:
;; (unify '(a b _) '(a b c d e)) => (+no-bindings+)

;;; The global variable *occurs-check* controls if circular bindings
;;; are allowed (and makes the code slower if turned on).

;;; 2) Instead of returning only one unifier (set of bindings) the unify
;;; function returns a set of unifiers. The more simple unification returning
;;; only one set of bindings is called unify-simple.

;;; 3) A function (fcg-merge pattern source &key (bindings +no-bindings+))
;;; defined is that tries to extend the source such that it unifies with the
;;; pattern. It returns a list of pairs of which the car is the extended source
;;; and the cdr is the result of unifying this extended source with the
;;; pattern.
