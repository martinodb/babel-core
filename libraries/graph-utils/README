by: Kevin Raison
dependencies: cl-ppcre, dso-lex, cl-yacc, trivial-shell, parse-number, bordeaux-threads

Implements the following functionality:

    1.  Create directed and undirected graphs with typed or untyped edges
    2.  Compare graphs using graph= method
    3.  Sparse 2D array representation of adjacency matrix
    4.  Neighbors, outbound-edges and inbound-edges methods for listing a node's neighbors in directed and undirected graphs
    5.  Edge deletion and creation methods
    6.  Functions for mapping over all nodes and edges
    7.  Denisty calculation
    8.  Node degree & degree distribution calculation
    9.  An implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm
    10. Distance map calculation
    11. Methods to find all components in a graph
    12. Graph visualization using the Graphviz library
    13. Random graph generation using the erdos-renyi and barabasi-albert algorithms
    14. Clustering algorithms based on edge betweenness and edge span
    15. Page rank and page rank distribution calculation
    16. Hubs and authorities calculation
    17. Graph center calculator
    18. Maximum flow calculation for directed graphs using The Push-Relabel method, Karzanov's algorithm, Dinic's algorithm, and the Edmond/Karp method
    19. Maximum matching for bipartite graphs using the max-flow method
    20. GML and Pajek .net graph file format parsers
    21. A prolog implementation for searching graphs based on PAIP
